## Overview

Built with Express, React, and CSS Modules. This page contains three checkbox filters that control the display table of Rick and Morty tidbits. If no checkboxes are selected then there is no filtering. The table also has sorting capability, but by default the order is as received from the server. The Rick and Morty endpoint is called from a mini node server and some cleanup of the response is also done in the server. The page is dynamic and works for all devices and screen sizes.

## To Run Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `webpack -p`
### `node server.js`

Open (http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
